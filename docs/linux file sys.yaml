Linux File System 

/ (Root): The foundational directory where all other directories and files are organized.

/bin: Home to essential binary executables, critical for system repair and single-user mode.

/boot: The storage room for all the files needed to boot up your Linux OS, including the kernel.

/dev: Represents your hardware with device nodes and files, the interface for peripherals and components.

/etc: The administrative heart of your system, holding all the configuration files for system and apps.

/home: Users' personal space on Linux, with individual directories for everyone.

/lib: The library containing shared libraries, essential for the booting process and running system commands.

/media: The go-to mount point for all your removable media, like USB sticks and CDs.

/mnt: A temporary parking spot for filesystems and devices when you mount them manually.

/opt: The place for all optional and additional third-party software.

/proc: A dynamic pseudo-filesystem that's all about processes and kernel information, displayed as files.

/root: The private chamber for the root user, separate from /home for heightened security.

/sbin: Contains binaries for system administration, mostly off-limits to the average user.

/tmp: A temporary holding area for files in use by applications and the system.

/usr: A larger collection of user utilities and applications, including program directories.

/var: The variable section, where logs, databases, and other dynamic files are stored.
